# Workflow MCP Server

API pattern storage and replay, DPAPI-encrypted credential vault, data transform pipelines, watch polling, and workflow chains — all through one MCP server. Single Rust binary, 30 tools, zero runtime dependencies.

**Workflow is the graduation pipeline partner for [hands](https://github.com/josephwander-arch/hands).** Use hands to automate a browser task once, capture the underlying API calls with `hands:browser_learn_api`, store them with `workflow:api_store`, then replay via direct HTTP forever. No browser needed on future runs. 100x faster.

## What's New — v1.3.4

- **v1.3.4** — Fixed 69 UTF-8 mojibake sequences in skill reference files (em-dashes + arrows). Documentation-only patch.
- **v1.3.3** — Cargo.toml metadata cleanup (license, repository, description fields).
- **v1.3.1** — Two-Entry sentinel keyring probe on startup. Detects mock backends that don't persist across instances.
- **v1.3.0** — Cross-platform OS keyring storage (Windows Credential Manager, macOS Keychain, Linux Secret Service). `migrate_dpapi_to_keyring` tool for one-time migration from legacy DPAPI. Linux headless guard.

## The Graduation Pipeline

```
Day 1: Browser automation (hands MCP server)
        ↓ hands:browser_learn_api extracts endpoint patterns from network traffic
Day 2: Store patterns (workflow:api_store)
        ↓ Named pattern with URL template, headers, credential reference
Day N: Direct HTTP replay (workflow:api_call)
        ↓ No browser. No Chrome. No selectors. Just HTTP.
```

**The economics:**
- Browser session: ~3-5 seconds startup + page load + interaction + fragile selectors
- API call: ~50-200ms, no browser process, no DOM, no breakage from UI redesigns

**Production proof:** 24+ stored API patterns in daily use across Humana, Aetna, and UnitedHealthcare/Optum FHIR endpoints for Medicare insurance brokerage. Real `last_used` timestamps. No browser window ever opens.

## Capabilities

## Installation & Per-Machine Setup

This is a standalone Rust MCP server for Claude Desktop / Claude Code. Each machine that runs the server needs its own copy of the binary plus a few config tweaks.

**Quick install:**
1. Download the right binary from [Releases](https://github.com/josephwander-arch/workflow/releases) — `_arm64.exe` for Windows ARM64, `_x64.exe` for x64.
2. Copy to `C:\CPC\servers\workflow.exe`.
3. Edit `%APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json` — paste the snippet from [`claude_desktop_config.example.json`](./claude_desktop_config.example.json) into your `mcpServers` object.
4. Restart Claude Desktop.

For full per-machine setup (paths, credential vault setup, DPAPI notes), see [`docs/per_machine_setup.md`](./docs/per_machine_setup.md).

A future `cpc-setup.exe` helper will automate this entire process.

### Download

Grab the binary for your platform from the [latest release](https://github.com/josephwander-arch/workflow/releases/latest):

- **x64 Windows**: `workflow_v1.3.4_windows_x64.exe`
- **ARM64 Windows**: `workflow_v1.3.4_windows_arm64.exe`

Rename to `workflow.exe` and place wherever you keep your MCP server binaries.

### Claude Desktop Config

Add this to your `claude_desktop_config.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "workflow": {
      "command": "C:/path/to/workflow.exe",
      "args": []
    }
  }
}
```

See `claude_desktop_config.example.json` for the full snippet with both architecture options.

### Prerequisites

- **Windows 10/11** — DPAPI credential encryption requires Windows. On other platforms, credentials are stored unencrypted (development/testing only).
- No Node.js, no Python, no runtime dependencies.

### Verify Installation

Run `doctor.ps1` to check your setup:

```powershell
.\doctor.ps1
```

## Quickstart — The Graduation Flow

This is the core use case. You've been using hands to automate a browser task. Now graduate it to a direct API call.

### Step 1: Discover the API (hands)

```
hands:browser_launch()
hands:browser_navigate(url: "https://portal.humana.com")
# ... interact with the page ...
hands:browser_learn_api()  → extracts endpoint patterns
```

### Step 2: Store credentials and pattern (workflow)

```
workflow:credential_store(
  name: "humana_token",
  value: "<captured_bearer_token>",
  credential_type: "bearer",
  service: "humana"
)

workflow:api_store(
  name: "humana_member_search",
  url_pattern: "https://api.humana.com/fhir/Patient?name={name}",
  method: "GET",
  credential_ref: "humana_token",
  notes: "Discovered via browser_learn_api 2026-03-15"
)
```

### Step 3: Test it

```
workflow:api_test(name: "humana_member_search", params: {"name": "Smith"})
```

### Step 4: Use it forever — no browser

```
workflow:api_call(name: "humana_member_search", params: {"name": "Jones"})
```

When the API breaks (token expired, endpoint changed), the response includes a `fallback_hint` telling you to go back to the browser. Re-discover, re-graduate.

## Key Concepts

### Credential by Reference

Never hardcode tokens in API patterns. Store credentials by name in the DPAPI-encrypted vault, reference them via `credential_ref` in `api_store`. When tokens rotate, update one credential — all patterns that reference it automatically get the new value.

### Execution Model

`flow_replay`, `watch_check`, and `workflow_run` return **execution plans**, not results. They tell your session what tools to call with what parameters. Your session executes the plan. This is by design — workflow doesn't have access to other MCP servers.

### Data Storage

All data lives in `C:\CPC\workflows\` as JSON files with atomic writes (write to `.tmp`, then rename). Safe against crashes mid-write.

## Recommended CLAUDE.md Instructions

See `skills/workflow-recommended-instructions.md` for a copy-paste block to add to your CLAUDE.md. Covers the credential-by-reference mandate, graduation discipline, and experimental flow warnings.

## Examples

- `credential_storage.md` — DPAPI vault patterns and token rotation
- `api_pattern_replay.md` — Advanced API patterns with transforms

## Pairs With: hands MCP Server

Workflow and hands are designed as two halves of the same pipeline.

| Scenario | Use |
|----------|-----|
| First time doing a task | hands (browser) |
| Task has a known API pattern | workflow (api_call) |
| API call fails / token expired | hands (browser re-auth) then workflow (credential_store) |
| Need to transform API response | workflow (transform_pipe) |
| Need to poll for changes | workflow (watch_define) |

## Compatible With

Works with any MCP client. Common install channels:

- **Claude Desktop** (the main chat app) — add to `claude_desktop_config.json`. See `claude_desktop_config.example.json` in this repo.
- **Claude Code** — add to `~/.claude/mcp.json`, or point your `CLAUDE.md` at `skills/workflow.md` to load it as a skill instead.
- **OpenAI Codex CLI** — register via Codex's MCP config, or load the skill directly.
- **Gemini CLI** — register via Gemini's MCP config, or load the skill directly.

**Two install layouts:**

1. **Local folder** — clone or download this repo, then point your client at the local directory or the extracted `.exe` binary.
2. **Installed binary** — grab the `.exe` from the [Releases](https://github.com/josephwander-arch/workflow/releases) page, place it wherever you keep your MCP binaries, then register its path in your client's config.

**Also ships as a skill** — if your client supports Anthropic skill files, load `skills/workflow.md` directly. Skill-only mode gives you the behavioral guidance without running the server; useful for planning, review, or read-only workflows.

### First-run tip: enable "always-loaded tools"

For the smoothest experience, enable **tools always loaded** in your Claude client settings (Claude Desktop: Settings → Tools, or equivalent in Claude Code / Codex / Gemini). This ensures Claude recognizes the tool surface on first use without needing to re-discover it every session. Most users hit friction on day one because this is off by default.
